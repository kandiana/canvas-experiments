# Canvas experiments

This repository is a collection of my experiments with canvas created while I'm learning to work with it.

## [Max area triangle](https://kandiana.github.io/canvas-experiments/max_area_triangle.html)

Mini-app to help with studying triangles with following restrictions:

- one of triangle verticies is in point A
- one of triangle verticies (B) lies on smaller of cocentric circles
- one of triangle verticies (C) lies on larger of cocentric circles
- angle CAB is right
- the triangle area value is the largest of all triangles that fit above restrictions

If triangle for the given point A is not found, it won't be drawn.
