# Canvas experiments
This repository is a collection of my experiments with canvas while I'm learning to work with it.

## Max square triangle
Mini-app to help with studying triangles with following restrictions:
- one of triangle verticies is in point A
- one of triangle verticies (B) lies on smaller of cocentric circles
- one of triangle verticies (C) lies on larger of cocentric circles
- angle CAB is right
- the triangle area value is the largest of all triangles that fit above restrictions
